- Postional index is now standardly used because of the power and usefulness of 
the phrase and proximity queries. Positional index, in a nutshell, is to store 
a dictionary of terms pointing to document ids. Each document ids then points 
to a list of the position of that term in the document. Such representation 
allows proximity queries.
